Q 1. Binary Search
Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order, and an
integer target, write a function to search target in nums. If target exists, then
return its index. Otherwise, return -1.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4

Q 2. Find the Duplicate Number
Given an array of integers nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer
is in the range [1, n] inclusive.
There is only one repeated number in nums, return this repeated number.
You must solve the problem without modifying the array nums and uses only
constant extra space.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2


Q 3. Search Insert Position
Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if
the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted
in order.
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,3,4,2,2]
Output: 2

Q 4. Sort Colors
Given an array nums with n objects colored red, white, or blue, sort them in-
place so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the
order red, white, and blue.
We will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue,
respectively.
You must solve this problem without using the library's sort function.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,0,2,1,1,0]
Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

Q 5. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array
Given an array of integers nums sorted in non-decreasing order, find the
starting and ending position of a given target value.
If target is not found in the array, return [-1, -1].
You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
Example 1:
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]

Q 6. Length of Last Word
Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last
word in the string.
A word is a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.
Example 1:
Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5

Q 7. Set Matrix Zeroes
Given an m x n integer matrix matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and
column to 0's.
You must do it in place.
Example 1:
Input: matrix = [[1,1,1],[1,0,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]

Q 8. Pascal's Triangle
Given an integer numRows return the first numRows of Pascal's triangle.
In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above as in the example.
Example:
Input: numRows = 5
Output: [[1],[1,1],[1,2,1],[1,3,3,1],[1,4,6,4,1]]
